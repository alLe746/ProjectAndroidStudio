# HOW TO USE
The first time you use the app, you are asked to register.
just put the ID of one of the client (from 1 to 7)

If you already used this app (or you have some rest of this apk), you get a connexion page.
You have to put the same ID that you have already set when you registered.
If you don't remember it, you can reset. All local database will be lost, and you will be redirected to the register page

WHen you registered/logged in, you can access the values. By default, you get the local results (so you get nothing if you just registered or never updated)
When you want to update the database, you simply click on the update button. The connexion will be done in background, with an error message if the connexion didn't work (a toast).
